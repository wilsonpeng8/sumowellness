              <p>
              We started SumoWellness with one goal in mind: How can we improve people's health and allow them to achieve their health goals through the power of diet and nutrition? Most people out there know the importance of a healthy diet, but everyone has different diet needs based on their medical condition. We realize that there isn't a "one size fits all type of diet" and that there isn't a solution out there that can help people get access to the right nutritional diet based on their medical conditions. 

</p>
<p>Because of this, we decided to start SumoWellness in order to provide an affordable long term 1 on 1 nutritional coaching for people to achieve their health goals through a diet and a wealth of knowledge that they can stick with.</p>

              <p>Your busy dealing with all the other stuff in life, but health is important! There isn't a diet plan that works for everyone.

Whether your goal is to lose weight or improve your health, let our experts handle the hard work of finding out what works for you health wise as well as prefernce wise, so that you can have a plan that you can stick with in the long term.    </p>

              <p>Did you know the average dieter tries 5 times in a given year and fails? The main reason behind failure is because there isn't someone there holding you accountable and motivating you. Our coaches will check in with you regularly to ensure that you are following the plan and provide you with resources based on your nutritional needs. </p>

      <h5>How Do I Communicate With My Coach?</h5>
      <p>One of our biggest goals is to allow you to gain unlimited access to a personal nutrition coach. You might be eating out with family and unsure what you can eat or you might not know what to cook. We make it super easy for you to get access to your coach through mobile. You will be given a number that you can text anytime to get your questions answered. You can also use email. If necessary, our coach will call you to chat with you as well.</p>

      <h5>Are there any additional fees after I sign up?</h5>

      <p>Absolutely NOT! All you have to do is sign up for our monthly service and pay once every month. For a simple $39/month, you'll have access to everything mentioned above and your coach will work closely with you. We believe healthcare should be good, ongoing communication, affordable, long term, and not a 12 minute transaction. Solving real problems takes time and close communication.</p>
