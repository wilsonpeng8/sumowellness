              <p>
              We started SumoWellness with one goal in mind: How can we prevent ER/Urgent Care/Hospital visits and get all of our medical questions answered without having to pay for top hourly physican consultants? 75% of the health problems can be treated online without the need of co-pays, expensive hospital bills, waiting in line at the ER, or setting up long appointments with your primary care doctor. Our goal is to provide you with a team of medical experts that will work 1:1 with you until you are fully healthy again all from the comfort of your home.</p>

              <h2>Dedicated Team of Medical Experts</h2>
              <p>The problem with other virtual doctor platforms is that you end up spending a lot time and money booking consultant calls with different doctors. That generally is not setup to allow patients to form long-lasting relationships with their doctors. Typically, when you use an on-demand doctor app you are paired with a random doctor who does not know you or your medical history. At SumoWellness, we set you up with a team of 5-6 dedicated doctors with specialities who all work as a team to take good care of you. </p>

              <p>In addition to that, we believe that there isn't a "one doctor fits all". Treating a condition requires long term adjustment and care. In order to ensure that you are healthy again, we connect you with a team of doctors with all types of specialities. This includes a primary medicine physican, a dietitian to help with post recovery and nutritional advice, Health Coach, and doctors with other specialities depending on your condition and needs.</p>

They will also provide additional resources for you about your condition or esclate your case to another doctor in your team to treat your condition.</p>

              <p>You can message your team of doctors from virtually anywhere. You could be traveling, at home on your bed, or eating out with family. We'll always have someone online ready to chat with you and take care of you, so you never have to worry!

              <h2>Affordable</h2>
              <p>Our goal is to ensure that you are healthy and that you can have a peace of mind at the most affordable price. SumoWellness offers a monthly subscription plan for you to get unlimited access to a doctor without any hidden fees. We also offer affordable family plans so that you can create a custom health profile for your loved ones. After you become a member, you can communicate and solve problems with our doctors all you want. There are zero hidden fees or additional charges. We believe that a healthy life requires on-going support and ongoing communication with more than just one type of doctor. Solving real problems takes time and close communication. Unnecessary ER and specialist visits can cost a lot of money. Our subscription is affordable and reliable. You need access to a doctor, we got it. No excuses. All our plans start at $25/month.</p>

A good amount of our members are people who suffer from diabetics, high blood pressure, obesity and many more other similar chronic illness. These type of illness requires long-term nutritional balance and care.

              <h2>Time Saving And Peace of Mind</h2>
              <p>Most people are busy with their lives and doing a lot of traveling for work. Most people don't realize that they need long-term care until it is too late. With SumoWellness, our team of dedicated medical experts will always be there for you whenever you need it, so you can have a peace of mind and stay healthy even if you are on the road. It's possible to be both healthy and busy and we make it virtually possible.</p>
              <p>With SumoWellness, you can avoid all the unecessary hospital visits and long waits for your primary physican to respond. Getting appointments with good doctors takes weeks. In addition to that, your primary doctor might waste your time by passing you around to other doctors, so it can take months for you to get dianogsed and treated. SumoWellness elimiates the barrier of that and saves you time. It's like having a doctor in your pocket that will always be there for you.</p>

      <p>Yes. All our doctors are board certified physicians, and can prescribe many of the usual prescriptions available in a traditional office setting. Some medications might be restricted based on the telemedicine laws in your state. In addition to that, our doctors can refer you to other specialist or lab centers in the case where our doctors need additional resources such as x-rays, blood pressure test, or lab results.</p>
